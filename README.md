# stars-match

This project was built using code from an excellent tutorial by[Sameer Buna](https://jscomplete.com/playground/rgs3.9/).
Hooks used in this are **useState** and **useEffect**.

The code is abe to render both server and client side, i.e. if you turn off the Javascript from your browser,
it should still be able to render.
